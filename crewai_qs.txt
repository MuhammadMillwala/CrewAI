To initiate a deep dive into your personal brand's vision, mission, and target audience, I need to ask you some comprehensive questions. These questions are designed to unc over the core of your personal brand and help us create a strategy that aligns with your goals. Please answer the following questions in as much detail as possible:
1. What is the overarching vision for your personal brand? Consider what you ultimately want to achieve or be known for. 2. Can you define the mission of your personal brand? This should reflect your core values and what you stand for.
